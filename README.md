# Rajshahi Transport Management System

An android application containing all the information about buses, trains, flights, and ambulances of Rajshahi.

In this digital world, everything is becoming digital, every work is becoming digital rather than physical. Transport is the most essential and important part of life. Finding the perfect schedule of bus from thousands of buses at the bus counter or searching for the required train needs to go to the train station and the same for airplane and emergency ambulance service. It would be a time saver if all the information stays in one place. It would be very time-saving and easy for everyone if all schedules, ticket prices, and contact information could be stored in one mobile application, especially the android app. From this thought, the idea of making such Android app for the people of Rajshahi has been coming. Using this app, anyone can get all the time and ticket prices of bus, train, and flight and contacts of emergency ambulance services in one place.
